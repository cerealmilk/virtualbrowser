# jQuery.fn.virtualBrowser();

Turns any element into a virtual browser window (or iframe), attempting to
capture all link-clicks and form submits and convert them into ajax-requests,
and then (manipulate and) insert the response document into the
virtualBrowser element (which is the semantic equivalient of a real browser's <body>).

[Version 1.1](1.1/) is the current version, but the 1.0 folder is left in to support older scripts.

The [Documentation](1.1/jquery.virtualbrowser-1.1.js) is stored as inline comments in the un-minified script file.
