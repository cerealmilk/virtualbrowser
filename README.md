# virtualBrowser

...is a jQuery plugin that turns any element into a virtual browser window (or `iframe`),
and captures all link-clicks and form-submits and convert them into ajax-requests,
and then (manipulate and) insert the response document into the
virtualBrowser element (which is the semantic equivalient of a real browser's `<body>`).

For more details, [read the documentation](https://github.com/maranomynet/virtualbrowser/blob/master/1.1/jquery.virtualbrowser-1.1.js)
